* investigating galaxy quenching using MaNGA spaxels!

* Assess the quality of the inner density diagonistic (Woo et al. 2016 and others) using more precise measurements of inner density 

* Inner density difference between satellite and centrals of MaNGA galaxies as Woo et al. (2016) finds? If so -- smoking gun for ram-pressure stripping? 

* Investigate the spacially resolved impact of satellite quenching (e.g. gas content in the outskirts of satellites versus centrals)
